# GPU Particles

A simple particle system using compute shaders in Unity. This is a basic working example. I'm working on a more robust system with different rendering modes and more features called [Dust](https://github.com/kamindustries/Dust).

### Requirements
* \>=Unity 2017.3
* GPU with compute shader support

### Usage
Add the GPUParticles component to a Game Object and press play.   
Properties with two values imply a random selection between them.
